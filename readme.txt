To run the dynamic state tracker first create a virtual environment with python 2.7:
Make sure you have gi installed. (I this caused many problems for me)
Next, install the required libraries using this command:
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the project in your developer and run main.py
You will need a video file to text the application.
